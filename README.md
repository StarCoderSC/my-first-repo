## About Me

Hello World!

>> I'm ***StarCoderSC*** <<
I'm on a mission to become a **Python** pro and explore the endless possibilities of this awesome Programming World.

Here's a bit about me:
- Learning **Python** and building projects that push my skills.
- Passionate about **Tech** and **AI**.
- Exploring **Git** and **GitHub** to make dev collaboration easy and fun.
- Current learning to **Walk** xD.

**Nothing much, Just Work hard and Work Smart**
 
P.S. This is from my special Mona branch -- she's watching me grow.
